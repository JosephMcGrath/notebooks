# Metadata Massive Open Online Course: Unit 1 - Organizing Information

Series by Jeffrey Pomerantz, University of North Carolina

## [1-1: Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEGEJhJzrB0)

Metadata tells us about things. Can be simple things like title, author etc but can include much more information (e.g. the sensor used to collect data). In the internet, metadata's recorded all over the place (and a lot of information is often recorded behind the scenes).

The metadata can be created either by the creator of the data itself, other people or automatically by the system. Additional metadata can be created on top of other data (ad. infinitum.).

Different metadata schemes have shared elements, and also information more specific to an individual application.

## [1-2: The NSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC5I1vEI0tc)

At the time the course went up, a story about [the NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency) collecting metadata on phone calls was big in the news. This meant they could get around the wiretapping regulations. The metadata being covered most was:

* Number making the call,
* Number being called,
* ID of the cell tower (so some location information too),
* Time & duration of the call,

This can basically be used over accumulated data to track a wide range of people. The take-home message here is that metadata alone can have a large impact:

> Metadata *is* data.

See also traffic analysis of Enigma messages in WWII, where message headers were used to build up a map of German military organisations.

## [1-3: OSX Mavericks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHlP-gwHFZA)

Another example of metadata in the news. *OSX Mavericks* was Apple's latest opertating system at the time. This introduced a system of 'tags' that allows **descriptive metadata** to be assigned to files at an operating-system level.

This is also a case of metadata being used under another name, which often happens in the wild.

## [1-4: Data About Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d_8X5zAMVw)

An unhelpful definition of metadata is that metadata is data about data. This is accurate, but doesn't tell us much. Another version might be:

> Metadata is description.

Though raises 2 questions:

1. Description of what?
2. What does it mean to describe something?

The second is handled in the next video. As for the first, the 'what' can be pretty much anything. You can divide things up as you like (e.g. natural vs artificial or physical vs digital) but it doesn't matter, though the nature of the metadata might change.

When you describe something you make a statement about it. In any natural language you have a **subject**, the **object** (the thing acted upon by the subject) and the **predicate** (the relationship between the subject and the object). This three-part relationship will become more important later. The thing being described can be an information object too (so the 'data about data' definition can become recursive).

Not all statements are descriptive (e.g. 'this side up' is an instruction). They can be useful in metadata, but aren't relevant at this stage. (**Reference out where this is used later.**)

## [1-5: Description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og4nUn_Nec0)

There's a lot of overlap in ideas about description between 'Information Science' and 'Library Science' (though the link between the two is [not without controversy](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/20THCENT.pdf), reading around this looks to be about how the similar concepts are approached). Quite often they are combined to 'Library and Information Science'.

Because librarians have been describing things for such a long time they're quite effective at applying descriptions to things, defined as:

> For the purposes of storage and later retrieval and use.

Particularly in large collections, finding anything is going to be difficult without *access points* (library jargon). The most common access points would be:

* Title,
* Author,
* Subject,

These come from a long history of libraries working out that simple description is effective.

Depending on your worldview, things like house numbers or packaging labels could be considered metadata. These are *Administrative Metadata*.

### Subject Analysis

In Information Science, determining what something's about is *subject analysis* (what are the significant characteristics). Sometimes this is easy, but often it's difficult (title is often not related to the subject directly e.g. Moby Dick is not just about the one whale). The tricky thing is working out what is significant and what is a characteristic? This can be subjective and is context-sensitive.

Some things might not have a subject (a lot of music isn't *about* something). There's ways around that **Reference out where this is used later.**).

The word *aboutness* is sometimes used here as it comes with less baggage than *subject*. Not returning to that here.

## [1-6: Item vs. Collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bexOzdR0vxc)

There is a distinction between *item-level* description and *collection level* description.

* Item = single object
* Collection = aggregation of objects
    * May be the same type of thing

As an example using [scientific papers](https://firstmonday.org), the abstract is item-level description whereas information about the journal is collection-level metadata.

[Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en) - interesting project that contains a collection of projects. Has online collections that cut across multiple different institutions.

## [1-7: Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCgA5ZHUkN4)

A real-world example, but an old and widely applicable one.
