    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "There's [a few good visualisations of different projection innacuracies](https://youtu.be/ZIEyHdvF474?t=7m11s).\n",
    "\n",
    "> all models are wrong, but some are useful\n",
    "> \n",
    "> George Box\n",
    "\n",
    "The same applies to maps - [no map can show the whole world without distortion](https://youtu.be/ZIEyHdvF474?t=5m53s) due to it being round, while the map is flat. The innacuracy comes from the projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a practical note, [basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/) is the relevant plugin for Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "### [A Tale of Two Coordinate Systems](https://youtu.be/ZIEyHdvF474?t=10m6s)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section's an overview of moving from a geographic coordinate system to a planar one. This is a good runthrough of coordinate systems, so I'll make notes in full.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Angular measurement.\n",
    "* Surface to project those measurements onto (spheroid / ellipsoid).\n",
    "* Offset for that surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Another good visualisation, showing different types of level.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIEyHdvF474&feature=youtu.be&t=11m0s)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Geoid - The gravity profile of the Earth.\n",
    "* Mean sea level.\n",
    "* Spheroid / ellipsoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "That then gives us two options for the type of datum:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Local / regional datum - The centre of the geoid is offset from the Earth's mass.\n",
    "    * Fits a local area well, but not for general use.\n",
    "* Geocentric datum - The centre of the geoid is the same as the the Earth's mass\n",
    "    * Fits the world as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then map projections can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cylindrical - good for a linear strip around the world,\n",
    "* Conical - accurate around a circlular strip,\n",
    "* Azimuthal - most accurate at a particular point,"

    "## [Good Map Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIEyHdvF474&feature=youtu.be&t=14m54s)\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a map, the projection is important - what are we preserving:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Angle (Conformal) - e.g. Mercator (for navigation).\n",
    "* Area (Equal Area)\n",
    "* Distance (Equidistant) - remember this is distance from *a given point*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, we lie when creating maps - just try to do it in a helpful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Robinson Projection ends up with some nice results, being designed more for an aesthetically pleasing world map than a particular metric of accuracy. For a thematic map is should generally be fine (though is *not* good for reference maps).\n",

    "### [Choosing the Right Map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIEyHdvF474&feature=youtu.be&t=17m49s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Four examples the speaker goes through:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choropleths\n",
    "* Dot Density Maps\n",
    "* Proportional / Graduated Symbol Maps - Data-based points (including charts as points).\n",
    "* Catograms\n",

    "### [Classifying Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIEyHdvF474&feature=youtu.be&t=19m32s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Three examples of how to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Equal Intervals - Equal size of ranges\n",
    "* Quantiles - Equal count of observations\n",
    "* Natural Breaks - Maximise inter-class differences, minimise intra-class variance\n",
    "    * Generally a good place to start.\n",
    "    * A general algorithm is 'Jenks' - kinda like a univariant k-means classified.\n",
    "* Manual Alterations - Always a good point.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always - the histograms are a good place to visualise breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Choosing the Right Colours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIEyHdvF474&feature=youtu.be&t=21m03s)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sequential - Ordinal data, typically by lightness, sometimes by hue too.\n",
    "* Diverging - Contrasting hue to show differences, lightness to show magnitude.\n",
    "    * e.g. Two colours for the end-points of positive and negative with lightness indicating magnitude of each.\n",
    "* Qualitative - Different groups, different hues.\n",
    "    * So long as they don't look sequental.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, [Cynthia Brewer's work](http://colorbrewer2.org) is great.\n"
