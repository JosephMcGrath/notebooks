    "#### Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "The ````collections```` module has a lot of specialised data types. These generally fill in gaps left by the bulit-in classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ````namedtuple```` is siimlar to a tuple, but allows fields to be named.\n",
    "    * Both the tuple itself and it's fields are named.\n",
    "    * Field names are passed in as a sequence or a set of comma-separated values.\n",
    "* ````deque```` is a list that's optimised for quick appending / popping at either end (doulbe-ended queeues).\n",
    "    * Can be accessed by indexes but not slices.\n",
    "    * *Slightly* less efficient on appending to the end than regular ````list````s with the bonus of being much quicker to edit the front end of with methods like ````popleft```` and ````rotate````.\n",
    "    * Has a useful ````maxlen```` option that is usefull if that's a requirement of your application. Adding items beyond the limit will push items off the other end.\n",
    "    * Can emulate slicing with ````ittertools.islice()````.\n",
    "* ````ChainMap```` is an interface for meshing multiple dictionaries together.\n",
    "    * Dictionaries put in more recently will have a higher priority for the same keys, letting values be overwritten as needed.\n",
    "* ````Counter```` makes counting hashable objects easier.\n",
    "    * Accessing items not already put in will return 0 rather than an error.\n",
    "* ````OrderedDict```` is like a dictionary that remembers the order items are entered.\n",
    "    * Equality between ````OrderedDict````s also depends on the orders of the keys, not just the key-value pairs.\n",
    "* ````defaultdict```` is like a dictionary that stores a function to used if a particular key doesn't exist.\n",
    "* ````UserDict````, ````UserList```` and ````UserString```` are largely obselete but are basically mirrors of their respective base classes that are slightly less locked down and so can be adjusted easier."
